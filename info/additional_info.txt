As explained in my book, High-Performance Java Persistence, Hibernate offers features that are not yet supported by JPA:

extended identifier generators (hi/lo, pooled, pooled-lo)
transparent prepared statement batching
customizable CRUD (@SQLInsert, @SQLUpdate, @SQLDelete) statements
static or dynamic collection filters (e.g. @FilterDef, @Filter, @Where) and entity filters (e.g. @Where)
mapping properties to SQL fragments (e.g. @Formula)
immutable entities (e.g. @Immutable)
more flush modes (e.g. FlushMode.MANUAL, FlushMode.ALWAYS)
querying the second-level cache by the natural key of a given entity
entity-level cache concurrency strategies (e.g. Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.READ_WRITE))
versioned bulk updates through HQL
exclude fields from optimistic locking check (e.g. @OptimisticLock(excluded = true))
versionless optimistic locking (e.g. OptimisticLockType.ALL, OptimisticLockType.DIRTY)
support for skipping (without waiting) pessimistic lock requests
support for Java 8 Date and Time
support for multitenancy
support for soft delete (e.g. @Where, @Filter)
